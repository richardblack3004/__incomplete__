It's a beginner level flask application which is needs to be developed even more.
I know it sucks but I am just a beginner in web app development.
There are lot of frameworks out there but I chose flask because I only know flask.
You can always contribute in the front end part I won't tell anything.
You know, I am not a very good designer.
 
I will add a feature to take notes in this application.
You can help me to add that.

Have a nice day my dear fellow programmers.
